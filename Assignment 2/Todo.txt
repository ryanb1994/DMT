- Made a 3d plot for star vs reviews with bookings. See the "stars_reviews_bookings.py".

NEW

- Did write a part on overleaf about dates. That includes promotions tags, clicks, bookings etc.

- I did write code about comparison in stars vs reviews. I will place that in overleaf on 13 may. Further I will check how influence the position of hotel could result bookings. That also will be written in overleaf.

Jeffrey:

- Specifically srch_id, adults, children, room, saturday night etc don't have any effect on wether booked or not.
Always around these results. When clicked and booked = 97% change, only clicked not booked = 3% chance, if not clicked never booked.
Not really variables that seem to have a different effect.

POSSIBLE FEATURES (Things that could be important for deciding)
---------------------------------------------------------------
-Price -> we have to check for specific dates, since it is more expensive in the summer.
-Number of stars
-Country where property is located
-Children
-Promotion flag

-Adult count
-Site id : Some properties got more booked with different sites (Found one site focussed on children also)
- Visitor location and distance: People book more close by


NEW: a preliminary and basic comparison of feature importance
